# Stroke prediction using ML

> This code was used for a machine learning class

We have a dataset, that contains several variables used to predict a stroke.
[Link to dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset)

I would recommend starting with _conclusion.ipynb_. It lists all of the observations made by the ML models and measures their accuracy.

Executive summary:
- Diabetic diagnosis can strongly increase stroke probability together with age

# How to prepare an environment

1. Clone into repository
2. Cd into folder in cmd
3. Use command "python -m venv venv"
4. Activate venv with ".\venv\Scripts\activate" (or activate.bat??)
5. You should see small text with venv on the left of your directory in cmd
6. Use command "pip install -r requirements.txt"
7. Congrats, you are done!
